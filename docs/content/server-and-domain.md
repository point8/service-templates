# Server and Domain

* Open a [new Issue](https://git.point-8.de/it/tachyon/-/issues/new) and request the `<subdomain>.point8.cloud` you need and 
* if you have any requirements on the computational part (If not, you get a [CPX11](https://www.hetzner.com/de/cloud)).
* Also please specify how long the service will be needed.
* Who else besides you, needs administration access to the server?
* Assign the Issue to Christophe or Vitorio ([Runbook](https://git.point-8.de/it/tachyon/-/blob/main/runbooks/service-templates.md)). Then wait for instructions.
